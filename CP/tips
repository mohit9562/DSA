✅ Always use fast input (BufferedReader + StringTokenizer)

✅ Collect output in StringBuilder and print once

✅ Use ArrayDeque for both stack and queue
        ArrayDeque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        ArrayDeque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
    // ArrayDeque can be used as both stack and queue as it implements Deque interface and it faster 


static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;   // 10^9 + 7  ✅ MOST USED
static final int INF = (int)1e9;        // 1,000,000,000 ( Infinity for int )
static final long INF_L = (long)1e18;   // 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 ( Infinity for long )

✅ Always use long for large numbers to avoid overflow

✅ Always use .equals() for string comparison instead of ==
